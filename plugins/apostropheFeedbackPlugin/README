# Apostrophe Feedback Plugin for Apostrophe 1.5

For complete and extensive documentation of Apostrophe please visit
[trac.apostrophenow.org](http://trac.apostrophenow.org/wiki/ManualOverview). There you'll find a complete manual organized much more conveniently than is possible with a README file.

The Apostrophe Feedback Plugin provides an easy way to add a simple form to your site that allows a visitor to the site to submit feedback, presumably reporting bugs found on the site.
The form grabs the current URL of the page that you're on and pre-populates a URL field and then e-mails off the submission to an address you specify.
Simple!

Installation:

0. Enable the apostropheFeedbackPlugin in your project's projectConfiguration Class [ /config/projectConfiguration.class.php ] :

1. Add the following entry into your project's app.yml file [ /apps/frontend/config/app.yml ] :

aFeedback:
	email_auto: 			'your@email'
	# If not specified, same as email_auto. This is the address suggested
	# via a mailto: link if the automatic feedback form somehow fails
	email_manual: 		'your_other@email'	# Optional
  # May have to be different at some point depending on your agreement with Akismet
  akismet_siteurl: 	'http://yourdomain'	# Optional
  akismet_apikey: 	'yourkey'						# Optional


2. The feedback plugin requires some CSS and Javascript to fully function. Add these assets to your project level view.yml [ /apps/frontend/config/view.yml ] :

stylesheets:
  - /apostropheFeedbackPlugin/css/aFeedback.less
javascripts:
  - /apostropheFeedbackPlugin/js/aFeedback.js


3. Enable the module in your project's settings.yml [ /apps/frontend/config/settings.yml ] :

	enabled_modules:
		- aFeedback

Note: depending on your environment, you may have to configure it to be able to send e-mail, that can be handled in your project's factories.yml [ /apps/frontend/config/factories.yml ]

Usage:

<php include_partial('aFeedback/feedbackForm'); ?>

It's easy to use the feedback form in your project, simply include the form partial anywhere it is needed.
If you prefer to style the form yourself, feel free to omit aFeedback.css
